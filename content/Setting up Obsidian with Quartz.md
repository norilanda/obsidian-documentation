[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is an open-source static site generator specifically designed to transform an Obsidian vault into a clean, searchable, and link-aware website. It aims to replicate much of Obsidian's "second brain" feel on the web, including graph views and backlink panels.

## Why Quartz for Obsidian Publishing?

- **Obsidian-Native:** Built with Obsidian users in mind, handling internal links, image embeds, and other Obsidian syntax naturally.
    
- **Graph View:** Can generate a navigable graph view of your published notes, mirroring Obsidian's core visualization.
    
- **Search Functionality:** Includes robust client-side search across your entire published vault.
    
- **Backlinks & Transclusions:** Supports displaying backlinks at the bottom of notes and can render embedded notes (transclusions).
    
- **Markdown Extensions:** Supports many common Markdown extensions used in Obsidian.
    
- **Easy Deployment:** Designed for easy deployment to free hosting services like GitHub Pages.
    

## Basic Setup Steps

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and Git installed on your system.
    
2. **Create a Quartz Repository:**
    
    - Fork the official Quartz starter template repository on GitHub.
        
    - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
        
3. **Link to Your Obsidian Vault:**
    
    - Inside your Quartz repository, you'll find a content folder. This is where your Markdown files go.
        
    - You can either copy your Obsidian notes into this content folder or, more effectively, create a symbolic link (symlink) from your Obsidian vault's main folder (or a subfolder dedicated to public notes) to the content folder in your Quartz project. This allows you to edit notes directly in Obsidian and have Quartz see the changes.
        
    - Example Symlink (Linux/macOS): ln -s /path/to/your/Obsidian/Vault /path/to/your/quartz/project/content
        
    - Example Symlink (Windows Admin PowerShell): New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\path\to\quartz\project\content" -Target "C:\path\to\your\Obsidian\Vault"
        
4. **Configure quartz.config.ts:**
    
    - Edit this file to customize your site's title, description, navigation, and other settings.
        
    - Configure how links are resolved, how images are handled, and which plugins you want to enable (e.g., for graph view, search).
        
5. **Install Dependencies:** Run npm install in your Quartz project directory.
    
6. **Develop Locally:** Run npx quartz build --serve to build your site and view it live in your browser at localhost:8080. Quartz will watch for changes in your Obsidian notes and rebuild automatically.
    
7. **Deploy:**
    
    - Commit your changes to your Git repository.
        
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages by following Quartz's documentation for connecting to GitHub Actions, or use other services like Netlify/Vercel.
