title: Using Obsidian for Documentation
---

Obsidian, at its core, is a powerful tool for knowledge management, making it exceptionally well-suited for various documentation needs within software engineering. Its local-first, plain-text Markdown approach offers unparalleled flexibility, longevity, and control over your technical documentation.

## Why Obsidian for Software Documentation?

1. **Version Control Friendly:** Markdown files are plain text, making them ideal for integration with Git. This allows for clear version history, easy diffs, collaborative editing, and robust backup strategies – just like your code.
    
2. **Offline Accessibility:** All your documentation resides locally. No internet connection is needed to access, read, or edit critical project information.
    
3. **Future-Proof:** Markdown is a widely adopted standard. Your documentation will remain readable and usable for decades, independent of proprietary software.
    
4. **Interconnected Knowledge:** Obsidian's core strength is linking. You can connect:
    
    - Code modules to design decisions.
        
    - API endpoints to usage examples.
        
    - Bug reports to resolutions.
        
    - Team processes to individual responsibilities.  
        This creates a rich, navigable web of information, rather than isolated documents.
        
5. **Extensibility:** Community plugins can add features like Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, Excalidraw for hand-drawn diagrams, or Dataview for dynamic queries of your documentation, turning your vault into a dynamic information hub.
    

## Key Use Cases in Software Engineering

- **Project Documentation:** From initial design documents and architecture overviews to sprint retrospectives and decision logs.
    
- **API Documentation:** Detail endpoints, request/response formats, and examples.
    
- **Codebase Explanations:** Explain complex modules, design patterns, and internal workings.
    
- **Onboarding Guides:** Create comprehensive guides for new team members.
    
- **Runbooks/Playbooks:** Document operational procedures, incident response steps, and troubleshooting guides.
    
- **Meeting Notes:** Link meeting discussions directly to relevant projects, tasks, and code.
    

## Publishing Your Documentation

While Obsidian is excellent for internal, private documentation, you'll often need to publish some of it externally or for wider team access.

- For simple, fast sharing or public-facing wikis: Consider [[Integrating Obsidian with Static Site Generators]].
    
- For a fully integrated, hosted solution with Obsidian's native linking: Explore Obsidian Publish.
